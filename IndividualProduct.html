                <h2>Extra Details</h2>
                <p>The Australian Grand Prix proved that the team was the 3rd quickest behind Ferrari and Mercedes. Verstappen qualified in 5th, almost 1.3 seconds off Lewis Hamilton's pole position time and almost half a second down on Kimi Räikkönen in the Ferrari. Ricciardo meanwhile, crashed during his opening run in Q3 and received a 5-place grid penalty for changing his car's gearbox. In the race, Verstappen held his position and finished in 5th but misery continued for his teammate at his home Grand Prix as Ricciardo's car broke down during the installation laps and was forced to start 2 laps down as his mechanics worked to repair his car. Ricciardo later retired on lap 26 after his engine failed. He rated it as one of his worst race weekends in his whole career.</p>
